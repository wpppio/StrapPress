WP Press Press - A Bootstrap 4 starter theme called WP Press Press
===

WP Press Press is _s with Bootstrap 4.
It is a fork from the `braginteractive/StrapPress`.

## Why Fork?

- I added composer support, so that wordpress dev who uses a composer approach to wordpress, can use this right out of the box.
- I like to tag my projects, so this one will be properly tagged.
- Corrected a couple of stuffs here and here.

## Will this be compatible with StrapPress?

- Yes, I will periodically pull from the upstream `braginteractive/StrapPress`.
- I have kept the text-domain same as upstream.

## Purpose of WP Press Press

- Use **WP Press Press** as a parent wordpress theme, so that you derive a child theme.
- A concrete example is my own website, [WP Plus Plus](https://wppp.io) which uses a child theme approach, with `WP Press Press` as the parent theme.

## Notable features

These are inherited straigh from the upstream `braginteractive/StrapPress`:

* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A custom Walker menu class to implement the Bootstrap 4 navbar
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `inc/extras.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* Gulp tasks to speed up development.
* Manifest.js to complile and minify all your JS scripts.
* Organized Sass files that include Bootstrap 4 and Font Awesome.
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.
